## In the first course of the Machine Learning Specialization, you will:

- Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn.
- Build and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear regression and logistic regression


## Week 1
- Learn the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning and regression and classification tasks.
- Build a linear regression model.
- Implement and understand the purpose of a cost function.
- Implement and understand how gradient descent is used to train a machine learning model.


## Week 2
- Build and train a regression model that takes multiple features as input (multiple linear regression).
- Implement and understand the cost function and gradient descent for multiple linear regression.
- Implement and understand methods for improving machine learning models by choosing the learning rate, plotting the learning curve, performing feature engineering, and applying polynomial regression.


## Week 3
- Implement and understand the logistic regression model for classification.
- Learn why logistic regression is better suited for classification tasks than the linear regression model is.
- Implement and understand the cost function and gradient descent for logistic regression.
- Understand the problem of "overfitting" and improve model performance using regularization.
- Implement regularization to improve both regression and classification models.
